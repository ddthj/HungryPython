==================
HungryPython (HungryCities Game)
==================

HungryPython is the nickname for a WIP game that I have been trying to create in the past few years. 

I first attempted it in python, then java, and now back to python. This time I am confidnet in my abitity to finish it.

==================
Installation
==================
HungryPython will be made easy to install on PC and eventually MAC. 

A zip file will be provided which will contain the current version of the game as well as a pre-set up python configuration to run
without any hassle (unlike a lot of python games out there)

The game can still be played without the zip provided that you have python 3.x installed with pygame.
==================
GamePlay
==================

The goal of the game (until more are added) is to gather resources for your city and build up its defenses to be safe from
otheres. Survival of the fittest.
